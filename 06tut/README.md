# Chapter6:  useState Hook
- Content.js :

familar to "useState" (from 'react')

Change fuction "handleNameChange" use "useState" instead.

Change function "handleClick" and view Console in browser

- Error:

"const handleClick = () => {

        setCount(count + 1)

        setCount(count + 1)
        
        console.log(count)
    }
"

In the given code snippet, a function named handleClick is defined. Let's break down what it does:

The setCount(count + 1) line increments the count state variable by 1.

The setCount(count + 1) line again increments the count state variable by 1. This means the count value is incremented twice.

However, it's important to note that state updates in React are asynchronous. When you call the setCount function, React doesn't immediately update the state. 

Instead, it schedules the update and performs it later. This means that consecutive calls to setCount within the same function won't update the state immediately.

The console.log(count) line prints the current value of count to the console. However, the count value logged here will not reflect the incremented value because the state update is not immediate.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
